Description: 
    Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while deconvoluting DNA methylation 
    arising as mixtures of cell types.  The older method 
    (Houseman et al., 2014,<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu029>) is similar to 
    surrogate variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes additional use 
    of a biological mixture assumption.
    The newer method (Houseman et al., 2016, <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1140-4>) is similar 
    to non-negative matrix factorization, with additional constraints 
    and additional utilities.
